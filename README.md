The Employee Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline and simplify the management of employee data within an organization. 
Built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js), this system provides a comprehensive solution for managing employee information 
such as personal details and it can handle further enhancements. The project was a part of a course I completed on Coursera.
